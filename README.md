# MARKETING RABBIT 

[Marketing Rabbit Live](https://marketingrabbit.herokuapp.com/)

Markting Rabbit is a full-stack project with functionality inspired by Task Rabbit, and design and concept inspired by Catalant. It utilizes a Rails backend, a PostgreSQL database, and a React/redux frontend architecuture.

# GOALS

I set out to make an application that would connect businesses with digital marketing agencies using a similar procedure as task rabbit. However, rather than simply allowing users to search and find agencies who can fulfill their service needs (like task rabbit does) I set out to challenge myself and implement a sort of matching feature where a business fills out a project form and that form is then sent off to only those agencies that meet the criteria ( location, size, specialties, etc..). Businesses then respond with a proposal, and communication between the two parties begins. 

# FEATURES ( AS OF NOVEMEBER 3, 2017 )

* Users can sign in/sign up as either an agency or a businesses
* Users are redirected to respective dashboard 
* Business users can create and submit project forms 
* Business users can see a list of their projects
* Business users can see the current stage that their projects are in

# CHALLENGES 

* Enabling muli-user sign in 
* Backend associations to facilitate proper matching 

# FURTHER PLANS / FEATURES

* Agency users can view potential projects assigned to them by the system 
* Agency users can submit proposals for the project 
* Business users can also search/filter and choose agencies on their own ( much like task rabbit )
* Businesses and Agencies can chat on the platform once a business reviews proposals and chooses who to work with.
